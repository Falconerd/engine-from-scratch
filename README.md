# 2D platformer + shooter engine and game written in C

Learn how to create a 2D platformer shooter in
an arcade style with C and OpenGL.

The purpose of this game, engine, and series is
to teach how to create a game without using a 3rd
party engine.

The point is to show that one does not need to
build every feature or create the most complex,
general solutions to problems in order to have
a shippable product.

## What this is not

- The most efficient or flexible way to solve
problem X.
- A replacement for a general 3rd party engine.

## Current feature list

Everything on this list will be implemented in
the video series, and exists in one form or
another in [this codebase](https://github.com/Falconerd/games-from-scratch).

- Simple sprite rendering with OpenGL.
- Simple physics integration.
- AABB discrete and continuous collision
detection and response.
- Custom serialisation (handling configuration
file).
- Sound mixing.
- Simple entity system.

## Potential future feature list

I have created or are working on these features
in my current game project which uses a forked
version of this engine. If there is enough
interest I may create tutorials for them in the
future. I will post a video and poll at the end
of the current series.

- Batch renderer.
- Custom vector math library.
- Custom immediate mode UI library.
- Custom memory allocators.
- Scene management.
- Decoupled game loop.
